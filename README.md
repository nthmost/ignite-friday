# ignite-friday

Hi!  I'm Naomi Most.  I'm an engineer, artist, and mom.  I love rock climbing, aerial performance, singing, and philosophy.  I have lived in San Francisco for 15 years.

In this workshop we're going to build a very simple (and very silly) personality test.

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nthmost/ignite-friday/master?filepath=Ignite%20Friday.ipynb)

## WORKSHOP: DO THIS FIRST 

* [Load up the shared Notebook on Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nthmost/ignite-friday/master?filepath=Ignite%20Friday.ipynb) we're going to work from.
* [Set up a Kaggle account here.](https://www.kaggle.com/)
* Start up a fresh Notebook within Kaggle.
* Load up the finished ["13th Floor Compatibility Test"](http://text2gene.com:8501/) in your browser.
* Play with the personality test to get a feel for what it might be doing.

## What we're doing here

* Exploring methods to collect data and make sense of it.
* Taking some first steps with Python using Jupyer Notebook.
* A brief introduction to Streamlit, another open source Python toolkit.

## Other things you can do while we're hacking together

* Help a friend.
* Get help from a friend.
* Think about what interests you about the world.  How could building an app help you learn, make better decisions, or just have more fun?
* In Kaggle, click on the "Add Data" button at the top right-hand corner of your Notebook in Kaggle.  Take a look at all the datasets Kaggle lets you add to your project.  Try searching "climate change", "Koalas", or anything else that comes to mind.
* [Check out the 13th Floor Stem Soul Compatibility Test source code](https://github.com/nthmost/st-13thfloor/).  Notice what is similar between the Notebook we're working with, and [the code in the main script](https://github.com/nthmost/st-13thfloor/blob/master/13thfloor.py).

## Resources 

* [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/)  ...because it's actually the easy way.

* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) -- get started with an online Python notebook, free, right away.

* [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) -- when you're ready for more, use Streamlit to make full interactive apps quickly in Python.

## Articles

* [Data science for the 9 year old](https://medium.com/the-andela-way/data-science-for-the-9-year-old-e1e693df98f7).  A short article with cute images explaining what data science is and why you might want to play with it.

## About Me

I've been coding for more than 20 years (yowza!).  I've been using Linux since the late 90s and Python since about 2001.

I work at [Streamlit.io](streamlit.io), where I'm one of a small team of engineers building an interesting Open Source product called streamlit.  It lets you build apps all in Python that make cool things happen in your browser.  (I love using our own product to make apps because I really don't like doing front-end code!)

I do a lot of community work in an anarchist hackerspace called Noisebridge.  We provide free tools and classes for all kinds of making -- from basic electronics and programming to hydroponics, philosophy, and sewing.  

Noisebridge is at 2169 Mission St on the 3rd floor (look for the button on the gate).  Buzz us during the day and someone will let you in.  Be sure to ask for a tour!  <3
