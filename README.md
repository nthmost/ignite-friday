## About Me

I've been coding for more than 20 years (yowza!).  I've been using Linux since the late 90s and Python since about 2001.

I work at [Streamlit.io](streamlit.io), where I'm one of a small team of engineers building an interesting Open Source product called streamlit.  It lets you build apps all in Python that make cool things happen in your browser.  (I love using our own product to make apps because I really don't like doing front-end code!)

I do a lot of community work in an anarchist hackerspace called Noisebridge.  We provide free tools and classes for all kinds of making -- from basic electronics and programming to hydroponics, philosophy, and sewing.  

Noisebridge is at 2169 Mission St on the 3rd floor (look for the button on the gate).  Buzz us during the day and someone will let you in.  Be sure to ask for a tour!  <3
